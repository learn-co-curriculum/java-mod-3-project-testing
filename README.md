## Project Work Time

Now that we have learned a little more about testing in Java, it's time to
apply this new knowledge to our projects!

Add unit tests to your project to automate testing. Consider the following
instructions:

- Create a unit test class for the `City` class.
  - There should exist unit tests to test the getter and setter methods.
- Create a unit test class for the `Airport` class.
  - There should exist unit tests to test the getter and setter methods.
    - Including methods to get/set the three-character airport code that we
      implemented after learning about regular expressions.
- Create a unit test class for the `Reservation` class.
  - There should exist unit tests for any getter and setter methods.
  - There should exist a unit test for adding a reservation.
  - There should exist a unit test for cancelling a reservation.
  - These tests should also capture the date-time object we added to this class
    after learning about date-time objects.
- Tips:
  - Refer to the code-alongs in this past section as needed to help you
    walk through the creation of unit tests.
  - Refer back to the Assertions lesson to see what assertions should be used.
    - Remember that unit tests are supposed to be small. Try to keep each test
      to one assert per test.
